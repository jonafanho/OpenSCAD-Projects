# OpenSCAD Projects

This is a collection of random models I am working on using OpenSCAD. STL files are automatically built on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jonafanho/OpenSCAD-Projects/actions). Note that a lot of things are still work in progress.

Check out my [Etsy store](https://3dtechdecor.etsy.com) where I am selling some of my models!
